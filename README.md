## My process

- The design looks simple but I think it's pretty tricky to get the background (but I finally got it)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned about layout algorithms article lately and used in this project. 
I was struggled to achieve the background svg images and learned about it by doing this project.
